# 🔐 Vulnerability Patch Management using LLMs

A full-stack, AI-powered vulnerability patch management system that scans networks using **Nmap**, analyzes vulnerabilities using **CVE databases**, and generates human-readable patch recommendations using **Large Language Models (LLMs)** like **Gemini**.  
Built with a **FastAPI** backend and a **React + Vite** frontend.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Nmap Scan Integration**: Automatically runs network and service scans.
- 📊 **Real-time CVE Analysis**: Parses and analyzes CVE/exploit data using the **Vulners API**.
- 🤖 **LLM Integration**: Uses **Gemini** to generate clear patch recommendations.
- 📉 **Visual Dashboards**: View CVSS severity distribution, priority levels, and exploit types.
- 🧩 **Severity Filtering**: Filter vulnerabilities and exploits by severity or type.
- ✅ **Track Fixed Issues**: View resolved vulnerabilities separately.
- 🧾 **PDF Report Export**: Download full vulnerability reports as PDFs.
- 🌐 **REST API Access**: Expose all core functionalities via RESTful APIs.

## 🧠 RAG Architecture (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

This system follows a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** model:

1. **Retrieve**: Extract vulnerability data (CPEs, versions) from Nmap → Query Vulners API for CVE & exploit details.  
2. **Generate**: Send the retrieved context to Gemini to generate tailored patch recommendations.  
3. **Deliver**: Display results in an interactive frontend with visual insights and reporting.

## ⚙️ How to Run

### 🖥️ Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dhairya703/hackathon-ihack
cd hackathon-ihack

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the FastAPI server
uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will be running at http://localhost:8000

# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend

# Install npm packages
npm install
npm install jspdf

# Start the development server
npm run dev
The frontend will be running at http://localhost:5173

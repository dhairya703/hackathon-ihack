    "remediation": "Without knowing the specific exploit details linked to that ID, a precise 1-line fix is impossible. However, **assuming it's a common SQL injection vulnerability**, a plausible fix would be:\n\n```python\n# Before: sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '\" + username + \"'\"\n# After:  sql_query = \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = %s\" % username\n```\n\nThis uses parameterized queries/prepared statements, treating the username as data rather than executable code, preventing SQL injection."

    "is_exploit": false,
    "cvss": 7.5,
    "severity": "HIGH",
    "description": "Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.\n\nIn a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with \"%{varname}x\" or \"%{varname}c\" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files.",
    "remediation": "**Remediation Summary:** Sanitize user-supplied data from SSL/TLS clients used in mod_ssl logging (CustomLog with %{varname}x/%{varname}c) to prevent escape character injection into log files.\n\n**Patch:** Upgrade to a patched version of Apache HTTP Server that includes proper escaping for mod_ssl variables in log files (versions after 2.4.63). Check the Apache HTTP Server security advisories for the specific patch information.",

    "remediation": "```\nSanitize or escape user-provided data before using it to construct file paths or commands within the HTTP server's code.\n```\n\nThis prevents attackers from injecting malicious code into file paths or commands, potentially leading to arbitrary file access or execution."
